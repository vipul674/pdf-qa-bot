    """
    Split text into chunks of roughly ``chunk_size`` characters with a
    sliding overlap of ``chunk_overlap`` characters, preferring natural
    sentence/paragraph boundaries over hard character-count cuts so the
    vector store can preserve cross-boundary context.

    The algorithm walks the text in ``chunk_size`` windows. For each
    window it searches right-to-left for the latest natural boundary in
    the lookahead region and trims the chunk there when one is found;
    otherwise it cuts at exactly ``chunk_size``. The next chunk starts
    ``chunk_overlap`` characters before the end of the previous one, so
    consecutive chunks share a tail of approximately ``chunk_overlap``
    characters.

    This is a pure-text utility with no embeddings or vector-store
    dependency, so it can be exercised in isolation.

    Args:
        text: Input text to split. ``None``, empty, or whitespace-only
            inputs return an empty list.
        chunk_size: Target maximum characters per chunk. Must be > 0.
        chunk_overlap: Characters of overlap between consecutive chunks.
            Must satisfy ``0 <= chunk_overlap < chunk_size`` so each
            iteration makes forward progress.
        boundary_patterns: Regex patterns marking natural boundary
            points, in priority order. The chunk's end is extended to
            the earliest match (rightmost-in-priority) within a
            ``chunk_size // 2`` lookahead so the chunk stays close to
            the target size.

    Returns:
        List of non-empty stripped text chunks. The first chunk starts
        at the beginning of the input; the last chunk absorbs any
        remaining text up to the end of the input.

    Raises:
        ValueError: If ``chunk_size <= 0``, ``chunk_overlap < 0``, or
            ``chunk_overlap >= chunk_size``.

    Example:
        >>> chunks = chunk_text_with_overlap(
        ...     "Sentence one. Sentence two. " * 100,
        ...     chunk_size=300,
        ...     chunk_overlap=80,
